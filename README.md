# A remote build cache for [Bazel](https://bazel.build)

bazel-remote is a HTTP/1.1 server that is intended to be used as a remote build cache for
[Bazel](https://bazel.build). The cache contents are stored in a directory on disk. One can specify a maximum cache
size and bazel-remote will automatically enforce this limit and clean the cache by deleting files based on their
last access time. The cache supports HTTP basic authentication with usernames and passwords being specified by a
`.htpasswd` file.

**Project status**: bazel-remote has been serving TBs of cache artifacts per day since April 2018, both on
commodity hardware and AWS servers. Outgoing bandwidth can exceed 15 Gbit/s on the right AWS instance type.

## Using bazel-remote

```
Usage of ./bazel-remote:
   --host value           Address to listen on. Listens on all network interfaces by default. [$BAZEL_REMOTE_HOST]
   --port value           The port the HTTP server listens on. (default: 8080) [$BAZEL_REMOTE_PORT]
   --dir value            Directory path where to store the cache contents. This flag is required. [$BAZEL_REMOTE_DIR]
   --max_size value       The maximum size of the remote cache in GiB. This flag is required. (default: -1) [$BAZEL_REMOTE_MAX_SIZE]
   --htpasswd_file value  Path to a .htpasswd file. This flag is optional. Please read https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html. [$BAZEL_REMOTE_HTPASSWD_FILE]
   --tls_enabled          Bool specifying whether or not to start the server with tls. If true, server_cert and server_key flags are required. [$BAZEL_REMOTE_TLS_ENABLED]
   --tls_cert_file value  Path to a pem encoded certificate file. Required if tls_enabled is set to true. [$BAZEL_REMOTE_TLS_CERT_FILE]
   --tls_key_file value   Path to a pem encoded key file. Required if tls_enabled is set to true. [$BAZEL_REMOTE_TLS_KEY_FILE]
```

## Docker

### Prebuilt Image

We publish docker images to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/buchgr/bazel-remote-cache/) that you can use with
`docker run`. The below command will start the remote cache on port `9090` with the default maximum cache size of
`5 GiB`.

```bash
$ docker pull buchgr/bazel-remote-cache
$ docker run -v /path/to/cache/dir:/data -p 9090:8080 buchgr/bazel-remote-cache
```

Note that you will need to change `/path/to/cache/dir` to a valid directory where the docker container can write to
and read from. If you want the docker container to run in the background pass the `-d` flag right after `docker run`.

You can change the maximum cache size by appending the `--max_size=N` flag with `N` being the max. size in Gibibytes.

### Build your own

The below command will build a docker image from source and install it into your local docker registry.

```bash
$ bazel run :bazel-remote-image
```

## Build a standalone Linux binary

```bash
$ bazel build :bazel-remote
```

### Authentication

In order to pass a `.htpasswd` and/or server key file(s) to the cache inside a docker container, you first need
to mount the file in the container and pass the path to the cache. The below example also configures TLS which is technically optional but highly recommended in order to not send passwords in plain text.

```bash
$ docker run -v /path/to/cache/dir:/data \
-v /path/to/htpasswd:/etc/bazel-remote/htpasswd \
-v /path/to/server_cert:/etc/bazel-remote/server_cert \
-v /path/to/server_key:/etc/bazel-remote/server_key \
-p 9090:8080 buchgr/bazel-remote-cache --tls_enabled=true \
--tls_cert_file=/etc/bazel-remote/server_cert --tls_key_file=/etc/bazel-remote/server_key \
--htpasswd_file /etc/bazel-remote/htpasswd --max_size=5
```

## Configuring Bazel

Please take a look at Bazel's documentation section on [remote
caching](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html#run-bazel-using-the-remote-cache)
