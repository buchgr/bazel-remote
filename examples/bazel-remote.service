# Example configuration for systemd based Linux machines.
#
# Customize this file and add it to /etc/systemd/system/
# then run "systemctl daemon-reload" so systemd finds the file.
# "systemctl start bazel-remote" will then start the service
# and "systemctl enable bazel-remote" will make systemd start
# the service after booting up.
